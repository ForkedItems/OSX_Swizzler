OSX Swizzler
============

For demonstration purposes, I built a demo application that essentially does nothing.  It contains a simple 'registration scheme' that just checks the validity of an input key and notifies the user if the application is registered or not.  Our goal here is to crack this application without making binary modifications to the original app.  Although we have the source code for this app, we will pretend that we are doing some black box analysis on it.  In order to gain a high level view of what is going on here, we can dump the class and method structure using the very useful tool `class-dump`.  
Below is the (slightly redacted) output of class-dump:
```

@interface AppDelegate : NSObject <NSApplicationDelegate>
{
    NSWindow *_window;
    NSTextField *_registrationTextBox;
    NSTextField *_registrationStatus;
    NSButton *_registrationButton;
}

@property NSWindow *window; // @synthesize window=_window;
- (void).cxx_destruct;
- (BOOL)isValidSerial:(id)arg1;
- (void)doRegistration:(id)arg1;
- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(id)arg1;

@end
```

The only function it looks like we really care about is `isValidSerial` that returns a boolean.  


Our general approach here is going to be to hook calls to [AppDelegate isValidSerial:] and replace it with our own function.
We can do so by making a SIMBL plugin and do some method swizzling.  

While developing the SIMBL plugin, I found it easier to symlink the bundle into the plugin folder rather than having to manually copy the bundle after every build:
```bash
ln -s /Users/fuzion24/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Swizzler-awlqvopkqunralfrlyrqcwxoipui/Build/Products/Debug/Swizzler.bundle ~/Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins
```

Demonstrates cracking an app without modifying it using SIMBL/method swizzling
